<h1>My name is Shyanne</h1>

<p> I am currently in the process of getting my associate's degree in IT. However, I love watching movies/binging shows, exploring my new town, and cooking for friends and family in my free time. You can also catch me experimenting with new dessert recipes and playing with puppies!</p>
