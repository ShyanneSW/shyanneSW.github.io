This Github account was created in CTI 110 class for my Lesson 5 Lab
The Repository that I created was to ensure that I can follow steps accurately so I will be able to use this program in the future
After creating a GitHub account and creating my repository, I downloaded the desktop GitHub application and worked on cloning my repository. I did this firstly by logging into my GitHub account and clicked my previously created repository and clicked clone. I then chose the location for my README file and saved it to my "Desktop" Folder on my macbook. I was then able to access my repository and make the edits and additions you see above.  
# About Me
## Hobbies
The hobbies I enjoy the most are anything related to the Arts. From singing in the car on roadtrips to baking a cake for my friends 30th birthday. I have also been cooking thanksgiving dinner since I was 8 years old! I've had my art win awards at school before too! Where creativity grows, that where I want to be. Many think because I love the arts so much that I can only be fully right brained, but I would say that I am pretty even. I enjoy the arts, but I also enjoy problem solving and love absorbing new knowledge about anything and everything. Also, to unpopular belive, I am also pretty decent at math.
## Websites I Find Interesting
- [Grammarly] (https://app.grammarly.com/) - I really enjoy grammarly and find it to be extremely helpful when typing papers because it helps me find errors that sometime I cannot. Ex; proper punctuation and correcting misspelled words.
- [Pinterest] (https://www.pinterest.com/) - Pinterest is a great website and app that has a ton of different pins that either can inspire a room remodel or a fun recipe to try for family game night! I get a lot of inspiration from Pinterest for fun dates and it helps a lot with outfit ideas for various occasions.
