This Github account was created in CTI 110 class for my Lesson 5 Lab
The Repository that I created was to ensure that I can follow steps accurately so I will be able to use this program in the future
After creating a GitHub account and creating my repository, I downloaded the desktop GitHub application and worked on cloning my repository. I did this firstly by logging into my GitHub account and clicked my previously created repository and clicked clone. I then chose the location for my README file and saved it to my "Desktop" Folder on my macbook. I was then able to access my repository and make the edits and additions you see above.
